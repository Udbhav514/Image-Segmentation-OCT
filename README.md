# Diabetic Macular Edema Segmentation in OCT Images  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on segmenting **Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)** in retinal scans presented as **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)** images. Using a **UNet-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, the model performs pixel-level segmentation to assist in the precise diagnosis and analysis of retinal conditions.  

## Features  
- **UNet Architecture**: A CNN designed for biomedical image segmentation tasks.  
- **Detailed Segmentation**: Goes beyond classification to provide detailed, pixel-level analysis of macular edema.  
- **Medical Imaging Insights**: Facilitates more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of retinal conditions.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of:  
- **10 MATLAB files** housing a total of **61 retinal scans** in OCT format.  

## Methodology  
1. **Preprocessing**: Converted OCT images to a suitable format for training.  
2. **Model Implementation**:  
   - Implemented a UNet-based CNN for segmentation.  
   - Trained the model to identify macular edema regions accurately.  
3. **Optimization**: Fine-tuned the model parameters to improve segmentation performance.  

## Results  
- Achieved precise segmentation, enabling better insights into retinal conditions.  
- Advanced diagnostic capabilities through detailed visual representations.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Deep Learning Framework**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras.  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib and other Python libraries for result interpretation.
